About
------------
UaNavigator is a console based OPC-UA server viewer.
It can be used for the following:
* read/writing variables
* browsing server namespaces
* method calling (still work in progress)

At time of writing it does not support:
* complex types such as structs, unions etc
* encryption ( simple to add)

The program has been tested with Beckhoff PLC's and seems to work with them.
The software has only been tested on linux.




The program is written in C++11 using open62541 and finalcut tui.
